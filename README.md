# &#129680; Cosmological-Fluctuations
Source code for PhD reseach pertaining to cosmological fluctuations in standard and conformal gravity

* Mathematica
  - Calculations performed in Mathematica include generating equations, varying geometries, decomposing tensors, and extensive simplification methods
  - Simplifying equations in general relativity requires software capable of symbolic tensor calculus
  - The third party package called [xAct](http://www.xact.es/index.html) allows one to take special derivatives (covariant derivatives), refactor dummy indices on tensors, expand metric connections, etc
  - `SVT3_RW.nb`, `SVT4_General.nb`, and `3_1_Splitting.nb` are the most heavily used modules, continually modified over multiple years
  - Unfortunately GitHub does not render Mathematica files; even worse, Mathematica is not open-source; in the future I may try to host them within jupyter notebooks on a server
